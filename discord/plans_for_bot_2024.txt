Here are features I would like a Discord bot to have
(implemented features removed from list)

Time conversion
    Too intrusive/hard. Discord doesn't provide a way to detect time zone, and asking for it seems annoying.
    If a user seems to have mentioned a time of day, a dynamic time-zone-adjusted timestamp reply gets posted (showing all users what time that would be in their own time zone) along with an "ephemeral" message asking if they want to keep it (bonus: let them adjust the displayed time)
    message objects have a datetime.datetime attribute called created_at
    Since 2022, this should be an "aware" datetime that includes the timezone
    This should be a timedelta object that is negative west of UTC:
    message.created_at.tzinfo.utcoffset()
        (Should be, but Discord doesn't make the timezone match the user's zone)

Game moderator (like the bot I wrote circa 2020).
    Lets people play HW in a Discord channel with rulkeeping and time control

State image generation
    I think this feature is also in the game moderator bot. It would let people generate game state images in a standard way.
